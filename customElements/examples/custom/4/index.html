<h1>Custom Element Ex4</h1>
<h2>Lifecycle Callback methods</h2>

<p>
  This clock at the end of this page updates every second, but it <em>only</em> updates
  because it's currently connected to this document.  It's good practice not to be doing
  unnecessary work, and this clock knows when it is connected and disconnected thanks to
  two standard functions that we have implemented.  They are
  <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_components/Using_custom_elements#using_the_lifecycle_callbacks">
    <code>connectedCallback</code> and <code>disconnectedCallback</code></a>.
  The browser calls these functions for us whenever our element is added to or removed
  from a document.

<p>To see this working, inspect this page and paste the following into the console:

<pre>
const clock = document.querySelector("digital-clock");
clock.remove();
clock;
</pre>

<p>
  Open the make element up in the console and you'll see the time that it was removed
  from the document.  If you re-add it to the document using the following code&hellip;

<pre>document.body.append(clock);</pre>

<p>
  &hellip then the time will briefly appear as it was before it was removed from the
  page (and then the new interval timer will kick-in and update it to the correct time.
</p>

<digital-clock></digital-clock>
