<h1>Custom Element Ex0</h1>
<h2>A <code>&lt;time-created&gt;</code> element</h2>

<p>
  In this example we define a <code>&lt;time-created&gt;</code>
  custom element.  The element contains text that shows the time
  it was created.

<p>
  The element is used here and it shows that this page was
  loaded at <time-created></time-created>.
