<h1>Custom Element Ex7</h1>
<h2>Pass-Through</h2>

<p>Once a shadow DOM is connected the contents of the real DOM are no longer visible.  These contents can however be copied into the Shadow DOM and reused.

<p>In an earlier example we asked you to copy code and paste it into the console.  It would have been nice to provide a buton to do the copying, but this might have made the example more difficult to read.  A web component would solve that problem by encapsulating the code - so that's what this example does.
