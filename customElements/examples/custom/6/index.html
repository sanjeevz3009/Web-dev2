<h1>Custom Element Ex6</h1>
<h2>Events in Shadow DOM</h2>

<p>
  This example shows how events can be respodned to in Shadow DOM just as they can be in the normal DOM.
  The <code>&lt;two-buttons&gt;</code> element contains two buttons.  When the buttons are clicked a report
  function writes the text of the clicked button to the console.

<p>
  A fairly simplistic example, but it gets the point
  across.
</p>

<two-buttons>
  ...there will be two buttons here...
</two-buttons>

<script>
  /**
   * Uncomment this code to show how the click events that are responded to on a
   * per-button level within the shadow dom are here reported as clicks on the
   * two-butons element.
   * /

  // document.addEventListener('click', e => {
  //   console.log(e.target);
  // });

  /**
   * In the twobuttons code, adding e.stopPropagation() to the report function
   * will result in the clicks being handled within the element and not sent-on
   * outside it to this listener.
   */
</script>
